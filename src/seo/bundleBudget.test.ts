// otherwise a stale build/ lying around locally fails an unrelated test run
// with a bundle error the developer did not cause, and the useful failure --
// the one right after `react-scripts build` in `npm run deploy` -- gets
// trained away. It also skips when there is no build/ at all.

 * The ceiling for the whole first-paint payload, in gzipped kilobytes.
 *
 * Still NOT the 150 KB the spec asked for, but the biggest single reason is
 * gone: task D1 moved the 17 non-English locales behind `import()`, so only
 * eng.json is inlined and a visitor downloads their own language, or none.
 * What is left in the entrypoint and does not belong to any one route:
 *
 *   - bootstrap + react-bootstrap, used by the shell, the navbar and every
 *     public page (retiring them is spec §5.6, out of scope here);
 *   - moment, iso-639-1's language table and react-icons, all pulled in by the
 *     *prerendered* /moments feed, which cannot be lazy.
 *
 * History, so the next re-baseline is a decision and not a reflex: B6's split
 * took the measured total from 724.5 KB to 559.6 KB and set the budget at
 * 559.6 + 5% = 588. Phase B's 90 marketing strings in 18 locales then added
 * ~45 KB gzipped (610.1 measured), and the budget was raised to 641 rather
 * than defended -- which is exactly why APP_BUDGET_KB below exists. D1 then
 * took 298 KB straight back out: main.js 551.6 -> 253.6 KB, total 608.0 ->
 * 310.0 KB measured, + 5% = 325.5 -> 326.
 *
 * That headroom is now real headroom, not locale slack: with 17 locales out of
 * the entrypoint this number can only grow if app code grows, so raising it
 * again is the same decision as raising APP_BUDGET_KB and needs the same
 * justification.

 * The ceiling for everything that is NOT locale JSON, in gzipped kilobytes.

 * The load-bearing half of this test. A single whole-entrypoint number is
 * trivially re-baselined: 18 locales grow, the total grows, someone bumps the
 * constant, and route code that crept back into main.js rides along invisibly.
 * Subtracting the locale weight leaves the number that actually tracks the
 * split, so a group collapsing back into the entrypoint fails here even while
 * the total still fits.
 *
 * Measured when it was set: 607.4 KB total − 305.8 KB of locale JSON = 301.5 KB
 * of app code, + 5% = 316.6 → 317. Same rule as BUDGET_KB, applied to the part
 * that is under this repo's control.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT re-baselined by task D1: no app code moved, and the number
 * it guards barely did (310.0 − 15.3 = 294.6 KB measured now, against 301.5
 * before). The subtraction has simply got much smaller -- eng.json alone
 * instead of all 18 files -- so this and BUDGET_KB now sit only ~15 KB apart
 * and the two assertions largely agree, which is the point: after D1 there is
 * almost no locale weight left for app growth to hide behind.

 * which this budget never counted and still does not. Measuring all 18 here
 * would subtract ~306 KB that main.js no longer carries and hand app code a
 * 290 KB blind spot.
 *
 * Still an approximation on purpose, and an honest one: what ships is the JSON
 * inlined into main.js as a minified object literal, which no manifest entry
 * isolates, so the only way to weigh it exactly would be to parse the bundle.
 * Gzipping the source is within a few percent of that and, more to the point,
