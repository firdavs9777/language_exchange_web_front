// A guard on what a first-time visitor downloads before anything on a
// marketing page paints.
//
// Task B6 moved the bootstrap-icons stylesheet out of the entrypoint and into
// src/lazyIcons.ts, which only modules behind a React.lazy boundary were
// allowed to import. The profile redesign (task P4) rewrote the last three
// screens that spelled `bi-*` -- followers, following and visitors -- onto
// lucide, so lazyIcons.ts is gone and nothing in src/ names the package at
// all. What is still worth guarding is the rule that outlives it: the icon
// font must never be reachable from the entrypoint. Nothing else enforces
// that, and the bundle budget cannot: the icon CSS is ~13.5 KB gzipped and
// the budget's headroom is wider than that, so a regression would slip
// through as a number nobody reads.
//
// So: build the static import graph the way webpack does for the entrypoint --
// start at the three real roots, follow only *static* `import`/`export ... from`
// declarations, and stop at `import()`, which is exactly where a chunk begins.
// If bootstrap-icons (or a re-exporting module like the old lazyIcons) turns
// up in that graph, something eager imported it and the font is in main.css.
//
// Same idea as src/components/growth/storeUrls.test.ts: a cheap source-level
// rule, checked by reading files rather than by building.
