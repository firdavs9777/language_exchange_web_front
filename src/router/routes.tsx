// --- Eager: the prerendered public pages ------------------------------------
//
// Everything in this block is reachable from src/seo/publicRoutes.ts, i.e.
// scripts/prerender.js renders it to static HTML in plain Node. A prerendered
// page must never be lazy -- but note *why*, because it is not a crash: under
// React 18 a suspended component inside a Suspense boundary renders its
// fallback, so making one of these lazy would quietly emit a spinner-only page
// instead of failing the build. What actually catches that is
// src/seo/prerender/renderRoute.test.tsx, which drives every PRERENDER_PATHS
// entry through renderToString and asserts >500 bytes with exactly one <h1>.
// Eager is also the right call for weight: these are exactly the modules a
// first-time visitor needs at first paint.
//
// PRERENDER_PATHS today: / /download /meet /learn-korean /communities
// /moments /privacy-policy /terms-of-use /support /data-deletion /404.
// Add a page to SEO_PAGES and its component belongs here.

// so this call site is the one place the retry can live. The first argument is
// the sessionStorage key that keeps the one-shot reload to one per chunk.
