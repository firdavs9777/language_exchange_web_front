 * The trade is deliberate: a pricing section that renders nothing is worse than
 * one slightly stale. What must never return is a price that was never true.
 * If store pricing changes, update this and the test that pins it.
 *
 * Note: `productId` is empty. The fallback is display-only, and the empty id
 * ensures that if a purchase is attempted while the fallback is in effect, no
 * valid product id reaches the native store flow. That is acceptable — the
 * fallback exists to show a price during an outage, not to guarantee a purchase.
