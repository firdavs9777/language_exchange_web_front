// Tokens ported from the Flutter app's lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart so the
// two products share one visual vocabulary.
//
// These are ADDITIVE and brand-named on purpose. An earlier draft overrode
// `teal`, `borderRadius` and `boxShadow` so that reaching for a Tailwind
// default produced the app's value. Measured against this codebase that would
// have broken 327 `teal-N` usages across 49 files (Tailwind REPLACES a colour
// scale rather than merging it), moved 232 radius call sites and re-weighted
// 102 shadows, including in Chat and Learning which no current sub-project
// touches. src/design/tokens.test.ts guards against reintroducing that.
